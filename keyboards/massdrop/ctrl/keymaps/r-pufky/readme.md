### Typing Layer

Layer optimized to enable useful keys for gaming without changing typing state, as well as specific
in-game overlay keys.

* Left Ctrl: Easier control key usage without always setting capslock.
* Num Lock: Unique non visible character key for additional left-hand input options in game.
* Fn: Enable layer 1, temporal.
* F24: Unique non-visible F24 key; no windows function. Map to in-game overlays.
 
### Function Layer

* Purple: Media keys. Note CD Eject on Escape, and OSX Prev/Next on Arrows.
* Blue: Keyboard adminstration. Toggle NKRO (N Key Rollover) and enable bootloader.
* Orange: RGB Controls.
* Red: Danger can break things! USB autodetect (always on) and USB GCR Auto control. 
* Capslock: Now requires the use of the function key.
* F13-F14: Extended function keys.
* Bright+/-: Monitor Brightness.

## GCR
GCR is the Global Current Register. Holds the value for current delivered to the LEDs, it's 165
default and has range 0-255. This should be auto managed.
